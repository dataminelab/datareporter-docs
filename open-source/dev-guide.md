DataReporter is a Python (3) and Javascript / Typescript app. To fully run DataReporter you will also need
PostgreSQL (version 9.6 or newer) and Redis (version 3 or newer). While it's not
needed in production, for development you will need a recent version of Node.js
(latest LTS version is recommended).

On the backend we use Flask, RQ and SQLALchemy (along with many other packages) and on
the frontend we use ES6, React and Webpack for bundling.

> **Note:** Windows users: while it should be possible to run DataReporter on a Windows machine, we don't know anyone who did this and lived to tell. We recommend using some sort of a virtual machine or Docker in such case.
