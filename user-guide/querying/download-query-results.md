Visit any query page and click the vertical ellipsis (`⋮`) button beneath the results pane. Then choose to download a CSV, TSV, or Excel file. This action downloads the current query result.

# How to get latest results via the API

Visit any query page and click the horizontal ellipsis (`…`) above the query editor. Then choose **Show API Key**. The links in the modal that appears always point to the latest query result. You can choose between CSV and JSON formats to be returned by the API call.

> **Info:** It's not shown in the interface, but you can also get the Excel format by changing the file type suffix from `json`/`csv` to `xlsx`.
